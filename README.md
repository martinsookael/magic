# magic  
Magical shortcuts for working with terminal.   

These one letter shortcuts would help you out with bower, node and git.  
An extra one is added to correctly install node-jay.  

# install  
Just add them to your existing bash profile or in case you do not have one, rename "bash_profile.md" to ".bash_profile.md" and put it to your home folder (/Users/username).  

# use  
"bower install jquery" >  "b install jquery"  
"git checkout -b new" > "co -b new"
etc     

Shortcuts:    
alias b='bower'  
alias g='gulp'   
alias n='node app.js'  
alias o='open .'  
alias s='git status'  
alias co='git checkout'  
alias bra='git branch'  
alias com='git commit -a -m'  
alias initio='git clone git@github.com:jayJs/node-jay.git .;git remote remove origin; npm install; cd public; bower install;'  

Magic WTF?  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(programming)    

In the context of computer programming, magic is an informal term for abstraction - it is used to describe code that handles complex tasks while hiding that complexity to present a simple interface. The term is somewhat tongue-in-cheek and carries bad connotations, implying that the true behavior of the code is not immediately apparent.
The term magic here reflects the fact that commands are usually just one letter long, therefore no-one can really figure out what they mean.
